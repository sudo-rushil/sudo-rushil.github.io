## A Sustainable 1-Pot, 3-Step Synthesis of Boscalid Using Part per Million Level Pd Catalysis in Water

Dec 3, 2019
Organic Process Research and Development

Boscalid is an active ingredient in several fungicides marketed by the BASF. Literature approaches use multipot processes, organic solvents, and unsustainable levels of palladium catalysis. Herein is disclosed a 1-pot, 3-step route using nanomicelles in water as the reaction medium and a very low loading (700 ppm or 0.07 mol %) of costly and endangered Pd. The sequence developed involves an initial Suzukiâ€“Miyaura cross-coupling, the product from which is not isolated. The second step relies on a carbonyl iron powder (CIP) reduction of the aryl nitro group, followed by the third and final step involving an acylation with the required 2-chloronicotinyl chloride. The overall isolated yield for these three steps is 83%.

## Odachi Retrosynthesis Engine: Graph Convolutional Networks for Template Free, Topologically-Guided Organic Retrosynthesis

March 16, 2020
CT Science and Engineering Fair

The development of novel synthetic methodologies is a main driving force in theoretical and practical organic chemistry and has applications in the production of innovative pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals. Retrosynthesis, a synthetic design methodology that systematically identifies bond disconnections in target molecules, is the root of all synthetic planning. Despite this, little has been done on the computational automation of retrosynthesis. Our research asked whether a deep-learning model could be developed to predict retrosynthetic disconnections with no template-based reaction rules. We report the successful development of the Odachi Retrosynthesis Engine, a graph convolutional network that can identify retrosynthetically similar clusters over molecules and find corresponding disconnections. The model uses spectral graph convolutions to identify topological synthetic contexts. We also develop a website (retrosynthesis.com) to host the engine and allow chemists to utilize the model for synthetic design. This work is the first application of graph convolutional networks to the retrosynthesis problem, and enables the development of efficient and advanced synthetic strategies.

## DGAIntel: Targeted Identification of Domain Generation Algorithms with Convolutional-Recurrent Networks

November 15, 2019

Modern malware makes use of domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to establish communications with a command and control (C&C) center, enabling it to execute malicious activities. DGAs generate thousands of domain names of which only a small percentage have been registered, to communicate with the botmaster, presenting an asymmetric challenge to defenders due to the scope of the detection problem. Despite the success of novel deep learning architectures to recognize maliciously generated domains, few implementations of such algorithms exist, hampering the adoption of the technology in security applications. Our research asked whether state-of-the-art DGA detection models could be improved upon for application to threat intelligence pipelines. We report the development of DGAIntel, a deep learning model that can identify whether a domain name is genuine or maliciously generated without auxiliary information. The model uses a convolution-recurrent architecture to quickly extract short and long distance information in domain names. Experiments show better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art DGA detection models. We develop a lightweight package that allows professionals to utilize the model for security applications. This work is a major implementation of deep learning architectures applied to DGA detection, and enables the integrated usage of DGA intelligence in system defense.
